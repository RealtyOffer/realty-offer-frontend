## 
The Impact of Higher Commissions

Typically, the commission can range from 5% to 6% of the total sale price or whatever your agent states. It might not sound like a lot, but expenses do add up pretty quickly. This fee is also divided among the seller’s and buyer’s agents. In fact, to recoup the losses, sellers pass on the added cost to buyers in the shape of a higher price tag on the property. So, even the slightest difference in commissions can greatly impact all parties.

## 
Sell Your Home for a Lower Commission

With so many developments unfolding in the real estate sector, you, as a home seller, have several options. A 6% commission isn’t a standard anymore. You can sell at a much lower fee now. But, understanding  what is important for your needs could save thousands at the end of the transaction. Besides, situations like market fluctuations tend to shift the commissions even lower. The average hovers between 5% and 6%, but it can drive down further in the coming times or rise as economy strengthens.
