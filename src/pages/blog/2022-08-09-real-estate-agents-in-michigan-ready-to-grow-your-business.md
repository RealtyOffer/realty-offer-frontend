Your clientele, your team, and the platform you work with also matters. So, build a complete package for yourself, and you will start marketing yourself automatically.

## Demonstrate a Strong Work Ethic

How do qualified and expert real estate agents in Michigan build a legacy for themselves? Having strong work ethic is the key. Be respectful of everyone’s time, keep your promises, and stay proactive. Know your stuff well and be willing to go above and beyond to turn your leads into potential clients. These habits give people reasons to build lasting relationships with you and refer you to those they know.
