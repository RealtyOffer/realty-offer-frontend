Owning a home in Michigan may be one of your most significant investments of all time. But, when it is time to sell your house, using a real estate agent offers many benefits. It helps you get win-win sale solutions for your specific circumstances. But, if you wish to go ahead with the sale by owner concept, here are some considerations to keep in mind before selling a house in Michigan.

## Selling a House by Owner

Start by setting an attractive (and competitive) selling price for your home with a realistic and unbiased view. Correctly pricing your home ensures it does not remain on the market for long. Next, make sure the house is in a retail condition, something most home sellers don’t pay much attention to but should. Upgrades are essential for potential buyers to set their hearts on your property. Another vital consideration is to list your home on a Multiple Listing Service (MLS) to kickstart the sale. Putting up “for sale by owner” yard signs, advertising on social media, or using something like Craigslist is also an excellent way for marketing your home.

Coming to the next steps – hosting an open house helps generate massive foot traffic while creating that sense of urgency among the buyers to put in a competitive request. Declutter, depersonalize, and keep the property presentable at all times. Show your home to potential buyers in a way that appeals to all their senses.

Once you find the right buyer, perform your own real estate negotiations. You can also consult a competent real estate attorney at this stage or find an agent to perform this function. Besides, make sure you comply with Michigan laws, so the contract does not result in an unofficial sale. You must also remember that as a Michigan home seller, you pay multiple fees and expenses to transfer the property in another person’s name. These can include owner’s title policy, Michigan transfer tax, deed fee, commissions, repair concessions, home warranty, and other miscellaneous costs.

Therefore, it is always best to research as much as you can concerning the potential market conditions in the area and easily navigate the selling process of your Michigan home.
