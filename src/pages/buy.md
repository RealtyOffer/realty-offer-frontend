  Purchasing a home is often the largest transaction a consumer will make in their lifetime. To this day, consumers are lost throughout the process. Sellers are paying too much commission, while there are no incentives to the buyer. RealtyOffer™ will connect the consumer with the agent, saving them money while avoiding the awkward negotiation. Our proprietary bidding platform is the first of its kind. RealtyOffer™ has automated the process of buying and selling a home while educating and saving the consumer thousands of dollars. RealtyOffer™ will allow agents to offer a percentage of their commission in order to pay for your upfront closing costs. Imagine getting paid to purchase a home!
