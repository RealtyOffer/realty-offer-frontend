  How is this possible? Well, as a buyer, your agent is only paid a commission if you close on a new home, and the commission that they receive is paid through the purchasing price of the house. So, it's technically the seller who pays for your representation.


  A conventional buyer's agent receives 3% commission from the seller. RealtyOffer™ agents bid to win your business by offering a portion of that 3% commission to be given back to you at closing.
