        way through.
    - question: Why are we doing this?
      answer: >-
        90% of consumers don’t understand the business and 90% of agents
        struggle to become a premier agent.


        Our goal is to make buying/selling a home or getting a mortgage, as easy
        and stress-free as possible.


        Our proprietary digital format will make it painless and free, while

    - question: Is there a guarantee your agent will sell my home?
      answer: >-
        There is never a guarantee in the market. Our agents will guide you and
        give you the best advice in order to sell your home at a discounted
        commission, which will maximize your profits. We refuse to mislead and
        offer you a guarantee that your home will sell in 24 hours. Although
        sometimes this happens, it is never guaranteed.
    - question: Do you sell every type of home?
      answer: 'No. At this time, we do not have a mobile or manufactured home division.'
    - question: Are there any contracts that I need to sign with RealtyOffer?
      answer: >-
        No. The questionnaire we require is a simple and non-binding agreement
        to use our service. It is up to you to sign a binding agreement with the
        agent you choose, after the criteria match and bidding process occurs.
    - question: Can any agent compete for my service?
      answer: >-
        No. Only certified-vetted and compatible licensed agents that are
        specialized in your home area and meet your criteria are permitted to
        bid for your business.
    - question: Do I need a pre-approval to put an offer on a home?
      answer: >-
        Yes. All agents require a pre-approval before placing offers on homes,
        on your behalf. This is the first step in the home-buying process. Our
        mortgage affiliates will guide you step-by-step for a free pre-approval.
        There is no up-front cost for this service.
    - question: 'As a consumer, am I obligated to use the awarded agent?'
      answer: >-
        After a bid is awarded, a client has the ability to meet or discuss with
        their chosen agent in private. It is up to you and the agent to make the
        choice of moving forward with a contract. RealtyOffer simply empowers
        the consumer and removes the upfront negotiation, in order to save you
        thousands of dollars.
    - question: Will my personal informational shared?
      answer: >-
        No. Your privacy is very important to us. We will NEVER share your
        personal information with third parties.

    - question: What is RealtyOffer?
      answer: >-
        We are an AI-Digitized marketing platform designed to connect the
        everyday consumer with an agent that is looking to increase their client
        base and brand awareness. RealtyOffer realizes there is a gap between
        knowledge to the consumer, and potential opportunities to the up and
        coming agent.
    - question: What is the cost to become a member of RealtyOffer?
      answer: >-
        Here’s how it works: After a vetting process, agents can begin to bid on
        consumer leads. Once an agent is awarded the lead, they have two
        options: 


        **1. Pay As You Go**


        The winning agent can choose to purchase JUST the lead they were
        awarded, one lead at a time, pricing varies from city to city.


        OR


        **2. Monthly Subscription for Unlimited Leads**


        The winning agent can choose to purchase a monthly subscription in the
        city, cities or counties of their choosing. No matter the number of
        leads awarded, the price is fixed.


        At any time, agents can expand their territory into multiple cities or
        counties. Restrictions do apply.


        Agents can choose to subscribe to multiple cities. Each city is assigned
        a cost based on its size and population density. Any pricing can be
        purchased with any major credit card.


        Our consultants are on stand-by to discuss any questions you might have.
    - question: How does my freemium subscription work?
      answer: >-
        Select agents are chosen from state to state to participate in a
        *RealtyOffer Pilot program.* With this program agents are permitted to
        bid at an unlimited capacity.


        If a bid is awarded and a sale or purchase is consummated, **RealtyOffer
        will charge a $595 marketing fee from the agents credit card on file, a
        binding agreement will be required during the freemium opportunity.**


        At anytime agents will have the ability to simply subscribe to any city
        of choice and avoid a $595 marketing fee per *"**Closed"***transaction.
    - question: >-
        Is there a guarantee the consumer will choose my services after I am
        awarded a bid? 
      answer: >-
        There is no guarantee. RealtyOffer is designed to connect a serious
        client with a serious agent. Clients and agents have a  mutual choice
        after meeting, if they would like to move forward. 


        The objective is for the agent to sign their agreement with the client
        after the awkward negotiation has been done through our proprietary
        bidding platform.
    - question: Is there a contract that an agent needs to sign with RealtyOffer?
      answer: >-
        Yes.


        There will be a subscription contract, as well as a non-compete
        contract.


        Agents will have direct information about a client and it’s very easy to
        circumvent the system. Our proprietary technology is able to track all
        home sales. Only awarded agents are allowed to contact the home buyer or
        seller after an initial connection through RealtyOffer.
    - question: Is there a review rating for the agent?
      answer: >-
        Yes.


        Clients can, and are encouraged to, post and star rate their experience
        through the system at any time.
    - question: How many agents are awarded a bid?
      answer: >-
        Only one agent is awarded a bid.


        The consumer will receive the system’s top 3 choices that bid the least
        commission or meet the consumers matching criteria. It is up to the
        consumer to choose from there.
    - question: Does a consumer pay anything during the process?
      answer: >-
        RealtyOffer is totally free to the consumer that utilizes the bidding
        platform.
    - question: What happens if I cancel my subscription to use RealtyOffer?
      answer: >-
        You have the right to cancel a subscription at any time. Monthly
        subscriptions are paid in advance, agents have the ability to cancel
        their monthly subscription right before their next billing cycle.
    - question: What happens if my subscription is not approved?
      answer: You will receive a full refund within 7-10 business days.
    - question: Will my personal informational shared?
      answer: >-
        No.


        Your privacy is very important to us. Your personal information will
        NEVER be shared to third parties.


        **RealtyOffer** reserves the right to cancel at anytime.
