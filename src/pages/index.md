  steps:
    - title: Step One
      body: >-
        Fill in some simple information, sit back and RealtyOffer will connect
        you with compatible agents, while removing the upfront negotiation.


        No contracts, no obligation, no awkward negotiation... and the best part
        about it, RealtyOffer is completely FREE!
    - title: Step Two
      body: >-
        Agents will receive your information and within 24 hours, agents have
        the opportunity to bid and win your business.


        The bidding works both ways: Agents simply discount their commission in
        order to sell your home or offer part of their commission towards your
        closing costs and pre-paid items for you to purchase a home - this means
        less money to the closing table!
    - body: >-
        Within 24 hours, you will be able to review three bids from compatible
        agents in your area.


        Choose your best offer and simply get connected, while removing the
        upfront awkward negotiation.
