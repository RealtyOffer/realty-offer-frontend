  RealtyOffer™ will connect you with serious clients. Instead of spending thousands of dollars on wasted real estate leads, agents will have the opportunity to simply bid for their next client.


  The bidding works two ways: agents can choose to discount their commission for a sale or offer part of their commission as a contribution toward client closings costs on a purchase – the amount offered is up to the agent.
