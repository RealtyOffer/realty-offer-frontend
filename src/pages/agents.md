  RealtyOffer™ will connect you with serious clients. Instead of spending thousands of dollars on wasted real estate leads, agents will have the opportunity to simply bid for their next client.


  The bidding works two ways: choose to discount your commission for a sale, or offer part of your commission for a purchase – the amount is up to you.
